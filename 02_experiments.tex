\label{cha:exp}

In order to investigate the barrier rocks, such as saltstone, claystone and crystalline, response under the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) processes, a series of laboratory and field tests in the scope of the GeomInt project are carried out. Initially, an introduction to the tested barrier rocks specifications and characteristics are provided. Next, the Opalinus claystone and saltstone responses under the coupled THM processes are investigated. The three-point bending, Brazilian disk and true triaxial tests are used to determine the fracture toughness, splitting strength and change of the mechanical and thermal properties under the coupled loadings, respectively. It is shown that the embedded layering orientation in the claystone samples has a significant effect on materials strength, deformation and frack paths. After determining the general material properties, distinct laboratory tests, which are chosen based on the unique purpose of the GeomInt project, are performed to analyze the shrinkage and swelling behavior of the claystone samples under free or in-situ loading conditions.  The results again indicate the effect of the anisotropy on the swelling and shrinkage direction of the claystone material. The fluid or gas driven percolation tests on Opalinus claystone and saltstone samples explore the change of the permeability, the required fracking pressure and the principle stress dependent frack paths. Additionally, the healing and frack closure characteristic of the barrier rocks are investigated. Moreover, the effect of the compressibility on the flow flux and drop of the reservoirs pressure when using brine or gas as fracking medium is presented. The direct shear test on the crystalline gives an insight of the shear characteristics of the joints under the constant normal load (CNL) boundary condition. Additionally, the constant normal stiffness (CNS) test with the additional of extra load to the CNL procedure is performed. Specifically, for the crystalline samples, the diffusion and time-dependence states of the fractures under the cyclic loading conditions are characterized. Eventually, the flow and pressure dependency on the deformations of the frack volumes and paths are studied.

%% Fracture Toughness
\subsection{X-ray micro computed tomography}
\Authors{Matthias Ruf (UoS)}
X-ray micro computed tomography ({\textmu}XRCT) is a non-destructive imaging technique and provides the possibility to examine the inner structure of an object by creating a digital 3D image of the same. It is based on the mathematical combination, called reconstruction, of several radiograms which were acquired from different directions. Thereby, a radiogram represents the respective measured intensity values $I(L)$ of the X-rays at position $x = L$ after travelling through the object and can be related to the unattenuated X-rays intensity $I_0$ before the object at position $x = 0$ by the Beer-Lambert law. Under the assumption of a monochromatic X-ray beam this can be written as 
\begin{align*}
I(L) = I_0 \exp\left(-\int_0^L \mu(x) \mathrm{d}x \right)
\end{align*}
for an inhomogeneous material with the unkown material depending attenuation coefficients $\mu(x)$ which are determined during the reconstruction process, cf. \cite{Carmignato2018}.

In Figure~\ref{fig:CTsystem} the self-made open and modular {\textmu}XRCT system at the Institute of Applied Mechanics - Chair of Continuum Mechanics of the University of Stuttgart, see \textcolor{red}{\cite{Ruf2020}} is depicted. 
\begin{figure*}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/exp_2_2_xray_main.png}
\caption{Overview of the {\textmu}XRCT-system. The light blue arrows show the possible moving directions of the motorized stages.}
\label{fig:CTsystem}
\end{figure*}
It consists of the three main components: The X-ray source (1), the X-ray detector (2) and the sample positioning system including the rotation stage in between (3). Like most industrial CT-systems the specimen is rotated during the scan and the remaining parts are fixed. The employed X-ray tube provides a maximum power up to \SI{80}{\watt} and at the same time a focal spot size down to \SI{3}{\micro\meter} for moderate power levels. The acceleration voltage of the tube can be adjusted in the range of \SI{30}{\kilo\volt} to \SI{180}{\kilo\volt} and the flux from \SI{10}{\micro\ampere} to \SI{1000}{\micro\ampere}. It can be chosen between two indirect conversion flat panel detectors with different characteristics and resolutions of $1944 \times 1536$ and $2940 \times 2304$ pixels. Both produce gray value images with a pixel depth of \SI{14}{bit} and each is separately mounted on high accurate, motorized XY stages. The latter offers the possibility to compensate for bad detector pixels by taking several images from slightly different detector positions and subsequently stitching of the same to improve the final image quality.

The geometric magnification $M$ is given by the relation of the source detector distance $SDD$ to the source object distance $SOD$, $M = SOD/SDD$, and can be adjusted in a wide range. Depending on the sample material and the smallest feature size of interest, the specimen's diameter can be up to \SI{100}{\milli\meter}. The maximum achievable spatial resolution of the system is about \SI{50}{lp/mm} at \SI{10}{\%} of the modulation transfer function (MTF) which means a smallest feature size of \SI{10}{\micro\meter} that can be resolved. The corresponding field of view for this case is \SI{5.88}{\milli\meter} in width and \SI{4.60}{\milli\meter} in height. Therefore, the smallest expedient sample diameter is about \SI{5}{\milli\meter}. The open and modular concept of the CT-system provides a broad range also for unconventional investigations.

In Figure~\ref{fig:exampleCarraraMarble} a CT scan of a cylindrical Carrara marble core with a diameter of \SI{5}{\milli\meter} for a high resolution scan is shown exemplarily.

The visible micro-cracks along the grain boundaries were created by thermal treatment and are not present in the virgin state.  The geometric magnification was set to $M = 24.76$ which corresponds to the highest achievable spatial resolution and leads to a voxel size of \SI{2}{\micro\meter}. For additional details see \textcolor{red}{\cite{Ruf2020}}. Besides a qualitative assessment, the data sets offer the possibility of deriving several additional information by image processing. For instance, in geosciences the 3D pore characterization, the 3D grain analysis and the fracture analysis, cf. \cite{Cnudde2013}. 

%% -----------------Fracture toughness (CAU Kiel)
\subsection{Fracture Toughness of the Opalinus Claystone}
\label{sec:Fracture_Toughness_Exp}
\Authors{CAU Kiel}
In linear elastic fracture mechanics, a materials resistance to fracture propagation is known as fracture toughness. The unit of the fracture toughness is $Pa.\sqrt m$ and the fracture toughness is measured under coupled or individual three different fracture modes I, II and III. In a three-point bending test, the flexural strength ($\sigma_{flex}$), flexural Young's modulus ($E_{flex}$) and flexural strain ($\epsilon_{flex}$) parameters are measured. The fracture toughness test using the three-point bending test provides the Mode I fracture toughness ($K_{Ic}$) of the material (Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Fracture_Toughness_Theory}).

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6cm,height=3cm]{figures/Amir_Fracture_Toughness_Theory.png}
\caption{The fracture toughness assessment using three-point bending test}
\label{fig:Amir_Fracture_Toughness_Theory}
\end{figure} 

The stress intensity factor ($K_I$) on the crack tip of predefined notch is obtained with (\ref{eq:Fracture_Toughness}) \cite{Bower2009},

\begin{multline}
\label{eq:Fracture_Toughness}
K_I=
\frac{4F_{flex}}{B_{flex}}
\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{W_{flex}}}
\left(1.6
\left(\frac{a_{flex}}{W_{flex}}\right)^\frac{1}{2}
-
2.6\left(\frac{a_{flex}}{W_{flex}}\right)^\frac{3}{2} 
\right.
\\ 
\left.
+12.3\left(\frac{a_{flex}}{W_{flex}}\right)^\frac{5}{2} -21.2\left(\frac{a_{flex}}{W_{flex}}\right)^\frac{7}{2}
+21.8\left(\frac{a_{flex}}{W_{flex}}\right)^\frac{9}{2}
\right)
\end{multline}

where, $F_{flex}$ is the flexural load, $a_{flex}$ is the length of the pre-defined notch, $B_{flex}$ and $W_{flex}$ are the thickness and height of the sample under the flexural test, respectively. During the test procedure, the load and crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) values are measured and plotted. At the load in which the crack starts to propagate into the medium the fracture toughness $K_{Ic}$ is calculated. In order to perform the fracture toughness test, a loading cell with three rolling supports is required (Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Fracture_Toughness_Setup_a}). However, the in-situ condition can only be reached when a material is under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Therefore, a climate chamber in a laboratory of CAU Kiel has been utilized to reach the desired temperature and humidity (Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Fracture_Toughness_Setup_b}). The temperature can be controlled between 20 to 80 $^{\circ}C$ and relative humidity varies from 0 up to 100.

The claystone samples are prepared with the dimension of 140x30x30 $(mm)$ and the notch dimension of 2x10x30 $(mm)$v $(LxWxB)$  (Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Fracture_Toughness_Sample}). The span length ($S_{flex}$) is 120 $mm$, which is 4 times the size of its width and thickness. The embedded layering is perpendicular to the loading direction. The image processing technique is used to track the reference points, which are predefined prior to the test procedure (Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Fracture_Toughness_Image_a}). The distance between the points is measured using the optical microscopic image and is considered as an initial reading value (Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Fracture_Toughness_Image_b}). The method is able to detect the minimum displacement of 2 micrometers, which is possible by taking 4k video with 30fps. The load vs. CMOD response of the Opalinus claystone as well as the numerical simulation outcomes are given in \ref{sec:mex01}. The effects of anisotropy and embedded layering orientation of Opalinus claystones on fracture toughness values are not fully studied.

%% ---------------------- Splitting Test (CAU Kiel)

\subsection{Brazilian Disk Test on Barrier Rocks}
\label{sec:Brazilian_Disk_Exp}
\Authors{CAU Kiel}
The tensile strength of a brittle or quasi-brittle material, such as rock, is one of the most important material properties, which in comparison to the compression strength, is much weaker. The measurement of direct tensile strength of brittle materials is difficult and time consuming. Therefore, finding the splitting tensile strength ($\sigma_{sp}$) is a fast alternative for computing the direct tensile strength. The Brazilian disk test is conducted to determine the splitting tensile strength (Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Splitting_Theory}). The splitting strength depends on loading rate, diameter and length of the specimen \ref{eq:Splitting_Strength}. The works of \cite{Perras2014} and \cite{Li2013} provides a full review and a correlation between different rock strength properties.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6cm,height=5cm]{figures/Amir_Splitting_Theory.png}
\caption{The Brazilian disk test on a cylindrical sample with diameter and length of $D_{cyl}$ and $L_{cyl}$, respectively}
\label{fig:Amir_Splitting_Theory}
\end{figure} 

\begin{align}
\label{eq:Splitting_Strength}
\begin{split}
\sigma_{sp}=\frac{2F_{sp}}{\pi L_{cyl}D_{cyl}}
\end{split}
\end{align}

In the CAU Kiel laboratory, the splitting strength under THM processes is measured. To do so, a controlled temperature and humidity climate chamber (Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Fracture_Toughness_Setup_b}) and a loading frame with a displacement transducer are required. Initially, the splitting test under room temperature condition with initial humidity of the sample is conducted. Afterwards, the temperature is raised to 50 and 80 $^{\circ}C$. The relative humidity can be controlled from 0 up to 100. Finally, the splitting strength, splitting Young’ modulus ($E_sp$) and load-displacement behavior are measured. The cylindrical claystone and saltstone samples are prepared in dimension of 100x200 $mm$ $(DxL)$ (Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Splitting_Sample}) and a strain rate of  0.1 \% is considered to insure a relatively fast loading rate. Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Splitting_Setup} shows the placement of the sample under loading frame before performing the test.

\end{figure}

Initially, the splitting strength of a saltstone samples under room temperature (20), 50 and 80 $^{\circ}C$ are measured. Due to a relatively homogeneous material property of the saltstone, the orientation of the sample will not affect the final outcomes. Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Splitting_Salt_20} and \ref{fig:Amir_Splitting_Salt_Result} depicts the failure in 20 $^{\circ}C$ and load vs. displacement for different loading temperatures, respectively. The observed failure pattern for all of the setups is identical. The measured mean splitting strength using \ref{eq:Splitting_Strength} for 20, 50 and 80 $^{\circ}C$ are 1.65, 1.59 and 1.43 $MPa$, respectively. As a result, the temperature has a slight influence on the splitting strength of saltstone, especially when the temperature is raised up to 50 $^{\circ}C$.

\end{figure}

The anisotropy of claystone and embedded layering orientation has a significant influence on material strength. To investigate the strength dependency on layering orientation, a series of tests, where the angle between the loading direction and layering orientation is 0 (parallel), 30, 45, and 90 (perpendicular) degree, is conducted. For 20 $^{\circ}C$, the failure pattern for 0, 45 and 90 degrees are provided in Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Splitting_Clay_0}, \ref{fig:Amir_Splitting_Clay_45} and \ref{fig:Amir_Splitting_Clay_90}. Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Splitting_Clay_20_Result} depicts the load vs. displacement behavior of claystone with different layering degrees.

Table \ref{table:Amir_Splitting_Table1} presents the mean outcome of the experimental tests for different orientation angles and temperature. The results depicts that when the loading is perpendicular to the layering orientation, the splitting strength of the claystone is almost 5 times higher than when it is parallel to the layering orientation. The temperature effect on splitting strength is negligible.

\subsection{True Triaxial Test on the Cubic Opalinus Claystone Samples}
\label{sec:True_Triaxial_Exp}
\Authors{CAU Kiel}
The true triaxial apparatus, where the stresses are controlled along three axes, is used to investigate the three-dimensional strain-strength behavior of soil or rock geomaterial (Figure \ref{fig:Amir_TrueTriaxial_Apparatus}). The true triaxial device in the CAU Kiel laboratory is able to reach a mechanical loading of 600 $MPa$ as well as a thermal loading of up to 600 $^{\circ}C$. The cubic samples are prepared in the side dimension of 43 $mm$ and the edges are slightly curved in order to avoid the stress concentration and failure in the corners (Figure \ref{fig:Amir_TrueTriaxial_Sample}).

The coupled thermo-mechanical loading conditions are considered in order to investigate the materials anisotropic stiffness along three axis, the elastic and plastic deformation under cyclic thermal and mechanical loadings, deviatoric stress field, and material failure. A thermal loading of up to $T_{iso}^{max}=150$ $^{\circ}C$ is considered, which is considered to be higher than the maximum temperature that the claystone samples are subjected to in nuclear waste disposal sites. The maximum isotropic mechanical loading is considered to be $\sigma_{iso}^{max}=100 MPa$. The considered boundary conditions are:


\begin{itemize}
  \item Sample MT-01: Mechanical Condition,5 loading cycles, $\sigma_{iso}^{max}=100 MPa$.
  \item Sample MT-02: Coupled Thermo-Mechanical Condition, 4 loading cycles, $T_{iso}^{max}=150$ $^{\circ}C$ and $\sigma_{iso}^{con}=12 MPa$.
  \item Sample MT-03: Coupled Thermo-Mechanical Condition, 4 loading cycles, $T_{iso}^{max}=150$ $^{\circ}C$, and $\sigma_{iso}^{max}=100 MPa$.
  \item Sample MT-04: Coupled Thermo-Mechanical Condition, 4 loading cycles, $\sigma_{dev}^{max}=60 MPa$, $\sigma_{conf}^{con}= 20 MPa$ and $T_{iso}^{con}=150$ $^{\circ}C$ .
\end{itemize}


With the installation of the ultrasonic sensors on the pistons, the apparatus is able to measure the ultrasonic $P$, $S90$ and $S0$ waves along the axis. The anisotropy factor, density ($\rho$), the dynamic Young’s modulus ($E_{Dyn}$), dynamic shear modulus($G_{Dyn}$), and dynamic Poisson’s ratio ($\nu_{Dyn}$) values can all be calculated according to the analytical relation which already exist in the literature \cite{Motraetal2018} as given in Eq. \ref{eq:YoungsModulus_Ultrasonic} and \ref{eq:PoissonsRatio_Ultrasonic}. In order to detect and analyse the ultrasonic signals in Opalinus Claystone, the minimum confining mechanical stresses of 12 $MPa$ is required. The test results of MT-01 (Figure \ref{fig:Amir_TrueTriaxial_MT_01_Result}) depicts the increment of the mean $E_{Dyn}$, $G_{Dyn}$ and $\nu_{Dyn}$ values under the isotopic confinement stresses up to 100 $MPa$, which is due to the layering orientation and structure of claystones and eventually improved contact qualities. It is also noted that the rate of the increment after each loading cycle (slope of the line) is decreased and due to the plastic deformations and improved contact qualities, the materials mechanical properties in initial loading condition of 12 $MPa$ are enhanced.

 Figure \ref{fig:Amir_TrueTriaxial_MT_02_Result} shows the deformation vs. time result of MT-02 in the 1st cycle. The thermal plastic deformation after 5 cycles of loading and unloading was negligible and can be neglected. The MT-02 sample is situated in a way that the loading frame in direction of Z is parallel to the layering orientations of claystone. The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient ($\alpha_V$) is calculated based on the measured volumetric strain ($\epsilon_V=\frac{\Delta V}{V}$) and temperature change ($\Delta T$). The effect of temperature on $\alpha_V$ is shown at Figure \ref{fig:Amir_TrueTriaxial_MT_02_Result_1a}. The rate of $\alpha_V$ is decreased after 80 $^{\circ}C$. The anisotropy in linear thermal expansion coefficient along Z, Y and X axis is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Amir_TrueTriaxial_MT_02_Result_1b}. The anisotropy in the measured linear expansion coefficient ($\alpha_L$) is substantially decreased after 80 $^{\circ}C$.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:ThermalExpansion}

\alpha_V=\frac{\epsilon_V}{\Delta T}=\frac{\Delta V}{V\Delta T}

The test results of MT-03 investigates the anisotropy of Opalinus claystone samples.Figure \ref{fig:Amir_TrueTriaxial_MT_03_Result} illustrates the $1^{th}$ cycle loading results of $E_{Dyn}$ and $\nu_{Dyn}$ values in X, Y and Z directions under the isotopic confinement stresses up to 100 $MPa$. The $G_{Dyn}$ has a similar behavior to the $E_{Dyn}$ values. The results indicate a weaker stiffness in Z direction, which is parallel to the layering orientation. The thermal loading upto 150 $^{\circ}C$ results in weaker $E_{Dyn}$ values during the heating process, which is the reason for the fluctuation of the results at the confinement stress of 100 $MPa$. The test results of MT-04 is similar to the MT-02 and the same material response is observed.

\Authors{CAU Kiel}

The shrinkage and swelling of claystone results in micro fracking and higher permeability values, which in nuclear waste disposal sites can lead to contamination of groundwater. Micro fracking also decreases the strength of the material subjected to THM  loading processes. Typically, the swelling pressure and heave of claystone is determined using Oedometer tests \cite{Peronetal2009}, where a constrained or unconstrained sample is subjected to the swelling process (Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Shrinkage_Swelling_Setup}). During the test procedure, the swelling pressure, as well as the heave magnitude, are recorded. It is also observed that the swelling pressure in sandy facies of claystone is lower than shaly facies. In contrast to the swelling tests, shrinkage tests are less common and are complicated to perform on rock materials. \cite{Minardietal2016} performed a shrinkage test on claystone with shaly and sandy facies using a desiccator and various salt solutions \ref{fig:Amir_Shrinkage_Minardi}. During the test procedure the axial strain values obtained from the strain gauges, as well as sample weight, are measured.

\end{figure}

Two prepared thin cylindrical sections of sandy Opalinus claystone (Mont-Terri) with a dimension of 100x10 $mm (DxH)$ are used to determine the anisotropy in shrinkage and swelling behavior of claystone. Due to the mineral structure of claystone and its layering orientation, the anisotropy factor has a significant influence on the direction of shrinkage and swelling as well as the micro fracking formation. The initial sample is used to determine the axial strains in parallel and perpendicular directions to the layering orientations \ref{fig:Amir_Shrinkage_Sensors}. The strain gauge strips (HBM, $LY 10 (mm)$/120 $\Omega$) are glued and attached to the surface of the sample. The second sample is used to measure the weight change in the sample under different salt solutions. The saturated salt solutions are located inside the desiccator and will result in osmotic suction and eventually in the wetting and drying of the samples (Figure \ref{fig:Amir_Shrinkage_Full_Setup}).

The total suction($\psi_{total}$) value can be measured using the Kelvin’s relation, which is derived from ideal gas law:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Total_Suction}
\psi_{total} = \frac{R_{gas}T}{V_{mol}} \ln(\frac{P_{vapor}^{curvature}}{P_{vapor}^{curvature=0}})
\end{equation}

where, $(\frac{P_{vapor}^{curvature}}{P_{vapor}^{curvature=0}})$ is the relative humidity, $P_{vapor}$ is the vapor pressure, $R_{gas}$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the temperature and $V_{mol}$ is the molecular volume of water. The considered salt solution and its induced suction and relative humidity values in the constant room temperature of 20 $^{\circ}C$ are listed in Table \ref{table:Amir_Shrinkage_SaltSolutions}. The equilibrium inside the desiccator is reached when the strain gauges value or water content of the samples are constant in two consecutive readings.

\subsection{In-situ Condition Desiccation Process (Stuttgart or BGR)}
\todo[inline]{[UoS/BGR](): More description please}
Topology, respectively morphology investigations of fractures induced in clay stone throughout drying processes require a number of experimental sequences ranging from the drying process itself to characterization of the induced fractures by X-Ray Computed Tomography. The required samples are prepared and characterized by the University of Kiel with a dimension of radius $r = 5 \, \text{mm}$ and height $h = 50 \, \text{mm}$ to guarantee the realization of scans in Regions of Interests (RoIs) down to a characteristic edge length of $6 \, \text{mm}$ resulting in a resolution of 2 micrometers per voxel.

Two different experimental set-ups are planned; nevertheless the first proposed experimental implementation is preferred over the second.

\subsection{Drying Wet Samples - From Wet to Dry}
\todo[inline]{[UoS](): More description please}
Saturated samples are prepared by the University of Kiel and submerged in a shrink tube in order to minimize the change of the desired state. Once the experiments are performed on the sample the shrink tube is removed and the probe is installed in an uni-axial testing device. The sample is installed in a heat chamber and loaded by an axial force of $f_{ax} = 500 \, \text{N}$/, resulting in an axial stresses of $ \sigma_{ax} = 0.25 \text{MPa}$ (potentially up to $f_{ax} = 5 \, \text{kN}$/$ \sigma_{ax} = 2.5 \text{MPa}$) while axial deformations are measured under controlled temperature conditions. By measuring the sample's weight at characteristic states (twice - beginning and end) the volumetric deformations can be determined and related to the change of saturation. The sample characterization is then completed by XRCT scans to determine the features of the induced fractures. Finally the stiffness degradation is determined by ultrasound experiments measuŕing the P-wave run times at 2, respectively 6 MHz.

\subsection{Wetting dry Samples - From Dry to Wet}
\todo[inline]{[UoS](): More description please}

Since it is extremely time consuming to increase the saturation of the sample this second setting is only an alternative to the introduced set-up in case the first experiment fails. The set-up is comparable to the proposed experiment but performed in a heat-humidity chamber at rel. humidity between 10 - 90 \% and temperatures between $5-90^\circ C$. The applied axial Force would reduce to $f_{ax} = 50 \, \text{N}$.

\section{Pressure Driven Percolation Laboratory Tests (WP2)}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Pressure Driven Percolation}
\Authors{IfG}
The determination of the permeability, which quantifies the flow behavior of fluids in the pore space of a rock, is based on the 
Darcy equation:

\begin{equation}
q = \frac{kA}{L\eta}\Delta p
\end{equation}

with:

$k$ : permeability (m$^2$) \\
$A$ : cross sectional area (m$^2$) \\
$l$ : length of sample (m) \\
$\eta$ : dynamic viscosity (Pa$\cdot$ s) \\
$q$ : flow rate (m$^3$/s) \\
$\Delta p$ : pressure difference (Pa)

Thereafter, the flow rate of a fluid through a sample at a given pressure differential is measured by the viscosity of 
the flowing medium, the geometric factor of the sample, and the permeability (with the dimension of an area). The 
permeability is given as SI-unit in m2 or, traditionally, in D (Darcy) (1 D corresponds to about 10$^{-12}$ m$^2$).

The equation above is only valid for incompressible fluids, because only then is the flow rate $q$ constant over the flow path. 
With sufficient accuracy, this applies to low compressible fluids.
When a gas flows through the pore space of a solid, however, an expansion of the gas takes place along the flow path, so that the 
flow rate is not constant here. In this case, instead of the flow rate $q$ the mean flow rate $q_m$ is set, for which, for small 
pressures with sufficient accuracy according to the law of Boyle-Mariotte 

\begin{equation}
q_m p_m = q_0 p_0
\end{equation}

with:

$q_m$ : mean flow rate \\
$p_m$ : mean pressure \\
$q_0$ : measured flow rate at $p_0$ \\
$p_0$ : pressure at flow rate measurement 

If, for the mean pressure $p_m$, the arithmetic mean of the pressures $p_1$ on the high pressure side and $p_2$ on the low 
pressure side of the porous solid is used, taking into account that $\Delta p = p_1 - p_2$, the modified Darcy equation for 
gas flows is as follows:

\begin{equation}
k = \frac{2p_0q_0\eta L}{A(p_1^2-p_2^2}
\end{equation}

In summary, the determination of the permeability with caustic or gas with knowledge of the viscosity requires in each 
case an exact measurement of the flow rate after setting (quasi) stationary flow conditions and the pressure gradient.

To carry out permeability tests, the IfG Leipzig uses a servohydraulic testing machine with a pressure cell up to pc-max = 1000 bar, 
which is otherwise used for strength tests with $F_{max}$ = 2500 kN (manufacturer: Schenk / Trebel) (Fig. \ref{fig:ifglabph4}). The tests 
routinely set hydrostatic pressure conditions ($\sigma_1 = \sigma_2 = \sigma_3$), but it is also possible to implement 
deviatoric stresses or defined deformations. The axial load or deformation and the jacket pressure are each controlled 
independently via a servo-hydraulic system. 

The desired jacket pressure is generated by a pressure intensifier. From the axial deformation and the measured change in 
volume of the lateral pressure chamber (piston displacement of the pressure booster), the volume change of the test specimen, 
referred to here as dilatancy, can be determined at constant jacket pressure.

In hydrostatic loads sintered metal plates are used, which allow over the entire cross-sectional area of the sample a fluid 
pressurization. The pressure measurement of the measuring fluid is carried out by pressure transducers from Hottinger 
(accuracy class 0.2), whereby depending on the measuring range a 20 bar or 200 bar encoder is used.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./figures/ifg-lab-photo4.png}
\caption{Triaxial IfG pressure cell for flow tests with brine or gas.}
\label{fig:ifglabph4}
\end{figure}

The measuring principle for permeability determination under stationary conditions is based on the measurement of the 
flow rate $q$, here under atmospheric conditions ($p_0$), in the axial sample direction at a predetermined pressure gradient $\Delta p = p_1 - p_2$ ($p_1$ = inlet 
pressure, $p_2$ = outlet pressure).

The measuring arrangement used in the triaxial cell has the following advantages over the frequently used Hassler cells, in 
which a cylindrical sample is firmly clamped between punches and is only subjected to radial pressure.

\begin{itemize}
\item Determination of sample deformation during hydrostatic and deviatoric pressurization
\item Use of variable sample geometries (stamp sets between 60 and 110 mm diameter are available, height up to 2 x diameter)
\item The height of the gas injection pressure is limited only by the available gas cylinder pressure (routinely max: 200 bar).
\item For higher gas pressures (up to 1000 bar), a Maximator pneumatic pressure booster is used, but this is only used for special measurements.
\end{itemize}

For the determination of gas permeability two methods are available:

1st: Injection of nitrogen at a defined injection rate within a range of min. 0.1 ml / min to max. 500 ml / min under 
measurement of the injection pressure when stationary conditions are reached with leakage of the fluid against the atmosphere.

2nd: Injecting nitrogen under a defined pre-pressure and measuring the flow rate at the exit side of the sample against the atmosphere.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

\caption{Variation diagram of permeability vs. flow rate for a sample with l = 220 mm and d = 110 mm at different injection pressures.}
\label{fig:ifgpermeflow}
\end{figure}

The lower limit of the measuring range depends essentially on the pre-pressure or the minimum measurable flow rate, as shown 
schematically in Fig. \ref{fig:ifgpermeflow}.

For gas permeability measurements, EL-FLOW mass flow controllers or flow meters from Bronkhorst are used with the following specifications:

\begin{itemize}
\item Mass flow controller Type: F-230M: Measuring range: (0) ... 10 ... 500 ml / min N2
\item Form: 200 bar / outlet pressure: 194 bar / temperature: 20$^\circ$C
\item Measuring accuracy: ± 1\% of final value, typ. better 0.5\%
\item Mass flow controller Type: F-230M: Measuring range: (0) ... 0.4 ... 20 ml / min
\end{itemize}

\subsection {The Fluid Driven Percolation Tests on Cubic Opalinus Claystone samples from Mont-Terri}
\label{sec:Percolation_Claystone_Exp}
\Authors{CAU Kiel}
The investigation of a fluid transport in claystone due to its anisotropic behavior and its role as a rock barrier in nuclear waste repositories has a great importance. Performing hydraulic fracking under pressurized fluid or storing pressurized fluids leads to the fracking of rock barrier and fluid transport through the hydraulic apertures and cavities. This can lead to pressure and volume drop in the reservoir, decrease the output and efficiency of the designed system and the contamination of ground water. In the geomechanics laboratory of CAU Kiel, the true triaxial apparatus with the maximum mechanical pressure of 600 $MPa$ and thermal loading up to 600 $^{\circ}C$ is used to conduct the fluid driven percolation in claystone samples from Mont-Terri \ref{fig:Amir_TrueTriaxial_Apparatus}. The syringe pump, with the maximum pressure of 517 $bar$, is used to pressurize the oil fluid. The cubic samples with the side dimension of 43 $mm$ and center hole length and diameter of 20 and 8 $mm$ are prepared \ref{fig:Amir_Percolation_Adapter}, respectively, and attached to the pump pipes, where the sealing is done with O-rings and epoxy glue \ref{fig:Amir_Percolation_Setup}.

Two different stress configurations, as well as fluid injection directions parallel or perpendicular to the layering orientation, are considered to investigate the fracking pattern as well as flow pathways. The fracking tests are carried out under a constant fluid pressure and the peak fluid pressure, where the flow rate increases and any sudden drops in fluid pressure is recorded. In the initial test, a sample with a fluid injection direction perpendicular to the layering orientation of the Opalinus sample is considered \ref{fig:Amir_Percolation_Orientation1}. The initial stress configuration is 12, 14 and 16 $MPa$ in three different loading directions \ref{fig:Amir_Percolation_Stress_1}. In order to prevent damaging the sample prior to the hydraulic fracking test, the isotropic stresses of 8 $MPa$ is applied from all pistons and is then gradually increased to the planned stress configuration. The oil pressure is increased gradually up until the point where the borehole pressure drops and an increase in the flow rate can be seen. The test is then aborted immediately in order to avoid causing any damage to the true triaxial apparatus. In the second test setup, a sample with a fluid injection direction parallel to the layering orientation of the Opalinus sample is considered \ref{fig:Amir_Percolation_Orientation2}. The initial stress configuration is 16, 10 and 8 $MPa$ in three different loading directions \ref{fig:Amir_Percolation_Stress_2}.

The set-up of the experiment is the same for CNL and CNS test. In the CNS test the stiffness which adds an extra load is calculated. This means if a normal displacement of the sample is measured the normal stress will be adapted according to the defined stiffness.

\subsection{Cyclic Loading Pressure Diffusion}
\Authors{University of Stuttgart}
In order to study characteristic, time-dependent states of fractures under cycling loading conditions a sample is prepared with a single fracture and borehole before it is installed in a triaxial cell as shown in figure \ref{fig:exp_cyclic_pressure_triax}. The dimension of the sample are chosen to be $r = 30 \, \text{mm}$ and height $h = 70 \, \text{mm}$. 
\begin{figure}[!ht]

\caption{Set-Up of triaxial cell.}
\label{fig:exp_cyclic_pressure_triax}
\end{figure}
The experiment is performed in three steps. After applying a confining pressure $p_{c}$ the initial state is approached by deformation control while the acting normal forces are measured in a first step. Once a desired normal force is reached the deformation state is held constant and a fluid pressure of $p_{fix}$ is applied. Finally, the fracture is stimulated by a harmonic fluid pressure with a frequency of $0.1 \, \text{Hz}$ and varying amplitudes $p_A$ between $0.5-3 \, \text{MPa}$. Throughout the experiment flow and pressure are measured at the fluid induction point to study the relationship of pressure and flow under non-constant fracture permeabilities triggered by deformations.
