\subsection{MEX 2-2: Closure and healing of cracks (IfG)}

Data management for MEX 2-2 (see \ref{sec:mex03}).

The measured gas flow is converted into permeabilities, which are stored as time series in an Excel file. For each of the three experiment there are two columns. The first contains the time in hours since the start of the experiment, the second contains the permeability.
