The data set contains all project files that are relevant to reproduce the simulation results described in Section \ref{sec:mex10} and its corresponding subsections. For every simulation run with OGS-6, the data set comprises a project file (\texttt{*.prj}), a geometry file (\texttt{*.gml}) and the computational mesh (\texttt{*.vtu}). For simulations run with OGS-5, the project is split into files for boundary conditions (\texttt{*.bc}), initial conditions (\texttt{*.ic}), fluid properties (\texttt{*.mfp}), material properties (\texttt{*.mmp}), solid properties (\texttt{*.msp}), numerical parameters (\texttt{*.num}), output parameters (\texttt{*.out}), process definitions (\texttt{*.pcs}), tabulated functional dependencies (\texttt{*.rfd}), source terms (\texttt{*.sc}), and output parameters (\texttt{*.out}). In addition, seperate files are provided for the geometry (\texttt{*.gli}) and the computational mesh (\texttt{*.msh}).
